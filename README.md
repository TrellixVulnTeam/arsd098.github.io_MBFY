# Final Project

## Summary

In this project, I implemented DIP (Dynamic Insertion Policy), TIP (Triple Insertion Policy) to improve cacche performance.
For the mcf Benchmark, DIP and TIP improved L2 cache performance by 0.57% and also reduced the L2 cache miss rate by 1.74%

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/arsd098/arsd098.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
